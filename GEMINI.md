# Julia Invocation Approval

Always request user approval before running any `julia` command so the harness can escalate out of the restrictive sandbox.

# Git Repository Guidelines

## Commit Message Guidelines (Codex CLI)
- Use GitHub emoji style subjects in imperative voice, ≤72 chars.
  - Format: `EMOJI (scope): Short imperative subject`.
  - Scope: usually a script name (kebab-case) or area like `img`, `audio`, `net`.
  - Examples: `✨ (mdview.sh): Add GUI preview via xdg-open`, `🐛 (img-trim.sh): Fix threshold for white borders`.
  - Common emojis:
    - ✨: feature/new option
    - 🐛: bug fix
    - 📝: docs
    - ♻️: refactor
    - 🎨: style/formatting
    - ⚡: performance
    - ✅: tests
    - 🔧: config/chore
    - 🚚: move/rename
    - 🔥: remove code
- Keep subjects focused and group related script updates in one commit to avoid unrelated churn.
- Bodies: never embed literal "\n"; use multiple `-m` flags (each becomes a paragraph) or a here-doc to build multi-line messages. Prefer bullets or short paragraphs instead of inlined `\n` escape sequences.
- Safe patterns:
  - `git commit -m "✨ (tool): Add feature" -m "- First bullet" -m "- Second bullet"`
  - `git commit -F - <<'MSG'
    ✨ (tool): Add feature

    - First bullet
    - Second bullet
    MSG`
- Amending safely: `git commit --amend -m "SUBJECT" -m "Bullet 1" -m "Bullet 2"`.

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Include purpose, sample commands, expected/actual behavior, and any external tool requirements (e.g., `ffmpeg`, `ImageMagick`, `pdftk`). Add before/after snippets or file counts when relevant.

Example
```
✨ (vim): Add lexima rules for TeX

- Add $, \(\), and \[\ \\] pairing rules
- Guard Markdown vimtex init behind exists() check
```

## Gemini Added Memories
- For true or false problems, consult `templates/sample-true-false-problem.md` for the correct coding pattern (specifically using `statement_pool` and printing prompts directly).
- Prefer using `\bfq`, `\bfv`, etc., over `\mathbf{q}`, `\mathbf{v}` for bold vectors in LaTeX/Quarto files.
- In each subproblem of a QMD file, there should be exactly one `long_answer` or `short_answer` call.
- A problem's title in a QMD file should match the name of the section it belongs to.
- When using `short_answer` and "no prompt" is desired, provide only the solution LaTeXString. This string will then serve as the label for the answer box.
- When a string does not contain math expressions (in $...$) use "..." instead of L"..."
- New problem files should include "-v1" in their filenames (e.g., "ex-19-v1.qmd").
- When turning a string `s` into a `LaTeXString`, use `LaTeXString(s)` instead of `latexstring(s)`.
- Always write \mathcal{B} in subscript as _{\mathcal{B}}.

## Development Guidelines
- AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, and CLAUDE.md are the same file; changing one updates the other two automatically.
- Commit frequently with small, focused changes.
- Test-driven development for complex components.
- Cross-platform mindset (Linux/macOS/Windows).
- Preserve epy behavior while improving performance.
- Initialize the `epy` submodule to consult original code; if SSH access is unavailable, switch the submodule URL to HTTPS before running `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

## Success Metrics
- Feature parity
- Performance improvement
- Memory efficiency
- Reliability
- Maintainability

## Feature Details

### Image Handling
- Images are preprocessed to include descriptive alt text (e.g., `[Image: filename.jpg]`).
- Image placeholders are centered in the reader view.
- Pressing `o` opens an image list for the current page.
- Selecting an image extracts it to a temporary file.
- The viewer attempts to open the image using:
    1. The user-configured `default_viewer`.
    2. `feh` (if installed).
    3. The system default (`xdg-open`).
- Relative paths for images are resolved against the content document path.

### Page Width Adjustment
- Users can dynamically adjust the text width using `+` and `-`.
- `=` resets the width to the global default (default 80 columns).
- The width preference is saved per-book in the database (`reading_states` table).
- Manual adjustments are preserved even when resizing the terminal window.
